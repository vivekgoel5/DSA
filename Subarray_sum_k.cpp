/*
To find the number of subarrays having a sum exactly equal to ùëò
k, we can use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums encountered so far. This approach is efficient and works in linear time. 

Approach:
1) Initialize a Hash Map:
    Use a hash map to store the frequency of cumulative sums encountered so far. Initialize the hash map with a cumulative sum of 0 occurring once. This helps in handling cases where a subarray starting from the       beginning of the array has a sum equal to K
2) Iterate Through the Array:
  a) Maintain a running cumulative sum as you iterate through the array.
  b) For each element in the array, update the cumulative sum.
  c) Check if the difference between the cumulative sum and k (i.e., cumulative_sum - k) is already present in the hash map. If it is, it means there are subarrays that end at the current index and have a sum equal to k.
  d) Add the frequency of cumulative_sum - k to the count of such subarrays.
  e) Update the hash map with the current cumulative sum.
  3) Return the Count:
    After iterating through the array, the count will hold the number of subarrays with a sum exactly equal to k.
